In the eastern regions of germany, when communicating time, it is common to use fractionals of an hour. So 09:15 would be called "Quarter ten", 09:30 is "Half Ten" and 09:45 would be "Three Quarters Ten".

While hanging with friends, we joked about why it is only quarters and halfes. Why not thirds, fifths, tenths, and so on.

So I wrote this calculator to convert the current time to this extended fractional time format. In order to fit on a watch screen, I still use numbers to represent the fractions.

Some examples:

05:25 - Five Twelfths Six, written as "5 / 12 6"

08:40 - Two Thirds Nine, written as "2 / 3 12"

15:39 - Thirteen Twentieths Four, written as "13 / 20 4"

11:42 - Seven Tenths Twelve, written as "7 / 10 12"
